# [ARCHIVED] restaf-uicomponents

This is a collection of components used in the restaf-uidemos and restaf-apiexplorer projects.
These components show how to use restaf with react components like
[material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)

**Note that restaf itself has no dependencies on any UI framework.**

## Usage
Include the library from  npm cdn repository as a script tag.
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/restaf-uicomponents@{version}/dist/restaf.uicomponents.js"></script>
```
## To build your own copy

Clone this repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/sassoftware/restaf-uicomponents
cd restaf-uicomponents
npm install
npm run build
```


## Material-UI react components.

This project uses the [Material-UI react components](http://www.material-ui.com/#/).
If you are a fan of [react](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material Designs](https://material.io/guidelines/) you should check out
Material-UI and see if meets your needs.

As of this writing(Mar 2018) Material-Ui is undergoing a major
overhaul and v1 is in beta.

Hoping that some of you will publish examples of using restaf with other UI frameworks like Angular.

## Warning
This version of restaf-uicomponents is intended to be a collection of examples
and is not ready for production use without further work.
